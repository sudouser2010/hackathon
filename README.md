# Gainesville Hackathon App

##Description
The purpose of this app is to locate code violations and report it to the city of Gainesville. Users are able to upload pictures and a description of violation. Then the administrator will receive an email of the violation. Development on this code base has been frozen.

## Setup
The app is functional even though it is not yet entirely complete. The email and database needs to be changed to the ones being used by the administrator. 

##Forkability (not a real word)
You are welcomed to fork this project and use it as a starting point.
